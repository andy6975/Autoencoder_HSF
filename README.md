# Deep Autoencoder Data Compression

Autoencoder is a type of neural-network architecture, where it takes an input and tries to reproduce it while extracting the useful and salient features of the data.

This repository is a study of various underweight autoencoder models judged on a task of compressing data, from 4-dimensions to 3-dimensions.
